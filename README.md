## Project Wiki

Project documentations can be found under [Wiki](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/q22wan/cs398-project/-/wikis/home) on GitLab. By clicking on the link, you arrive at the landing page for the project. The wiki also includes other detailed pages for different course deliverables:

- Meeting Minutes and Standups for project tracking

- Pages for each stage of the project (i.e. Introduction, Requirements, Analysis & Design, Implementation and Testing)

- Sprint summary pages, listing the major goals and issues that were addressed, and installers for the final sprint

- Acknowledgement of any third-party libraries that we have used

- Reflection on the overall project

## Issues and Milestones

We use [Issues](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/q22wan/cs398-project/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all) to track the work to be done (where an issue represents an assignable task, which may be a new feature, change to an existing feature, or a bug fix). [Milestones](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/q22wan/cs398-project/-/milestones?sort=due_date_desc&state=all) are a way of grouping issues into Sprints.

- Unassigned and opened issues represent our Product Backlog

- Issues are generally assigned to a sprint during the sprint kickoff meeting on Mondays

- We have milestones for the Infrastructure phase and Sprint 1 - 3.
